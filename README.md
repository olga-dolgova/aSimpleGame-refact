# A Simple Game

This example involves refactoring and test-driven design.

Suppose we've decided to develop a system to play games in the tic-tac-toe family: squares occupied by different markers. In tic-tac-toe, you have a 3 Ã— 3 grid, and you try to put your mark in three boxes in a row. In Connect Four by Hasbro, you have a rectangular grid and try to get four boxes in a row, but columns have to be filled from bottom to top. We'll start with a simplified version of tic-tac-toe and work our way up to the general case.
